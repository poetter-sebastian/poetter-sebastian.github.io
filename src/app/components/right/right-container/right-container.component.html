                        My name is Sebastian Pötter. I got my master's degree of computer science in 2023 and looking
                        for new opportunities to work on or get involved in projects.
                        <br><br>
                        With over a decade of expertise in web and software development, I offer comprehensive knowledge
                        and hands-on experience in crafting robust,
                        user-friendly solutions or provide consulting business partners on their planned and ongoing
                        projects.
                        As a seasoned full-stack developer, I specialise in both client and server-side technologies,
                        ensuring seamless and dynamic web experiences.

                        I take great pride in maintaining transparent and professional communication with business
                        partners and clients.
                        I foster a collaborative atmosphere to ensure project goals are aligned and met efficiently.
                        My ability to work cooperatively with team members and stakeholders is a cornerstone of my
                        approach, facilitating a transparent and
                        productive workflow. With the theoretical knowledge gained at university and practical applied
                        skills gained at my freelance work,
                        I'm able to familiarize myself quickly with new or existing projects.
                        <br><br>
                        I am dedicated to providing high-quality solutions and continuously developing my skills to
                        ensure I remain up-to-date with the latest
                        industry trends and technologies. My approach is collaborative and detail-oriented, ensuring
                        every project meets the highest standards of excellence.
                        However, computers and information technology are not my only interest, other areas such as
                        biology, chemistry, physics, and electrical
                        engineering are fascinating too.

                        I graduated from secondary school in 2014.
                        In Germany the Secondary school is called Realschule and leads to either
                        apprenticeships or, in my case, to higher education comparable to high schools.
                        Here I started getting interested in Computer and started building simple websites
                        as a hobby.

                        I made my higher education entrance qualification with focus on computer science in 2017.
                        During this time I worked on some simple projects and made free website designs.
                        Here I started to work with the game-development engine Unity and made some smaller
                        3D-applications.

                        I started studying informatics with a focus on software technology and programming techniques in
                        2017.
                        I got way better at programming, algorithm engineering and software planning.
                        After the course 'principles of mobile robotics' I started experimenting with arduino
                        and raspberry pi boards to create hardware like a weather-station for my home-sever.

                        So I thought that the master's degree is the best way for it.
