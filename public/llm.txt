## Education

### Secondary School (Realschule) - 2014
I graduated from secondary school in 2014. In Germany the Secondary school is called Realschule and leads to either apprenticeships or, in my case, to higher education comparable to high schools. Here I started getting interested in Computer and started building simple websites as a hobby.

### High School (Abitur) - 2017
I made my higher education entrance qualification with focus on computer science in 2017. During this time I worked on some simple projects and made free website designs. Here I started to work with the game-development engine Unity and made some smaller 3D-applications.

### University: Bachelor of Science - 2020
I started studying informatics with a focus on software technology and programming techniques in 2017. I got way better at programming, algorithm engineering and software planning. After the course 'principles of mobile robotics' I started experimenting with arduino and raspberry pi boards to create hardware like a weather-station for my home-server.

#### Bachelor Subjects:
- Algorithms and data structures
- Mathematics for computer scientists
- Application-/system-/parallel oriented programming
- Functional programming
- Automata and formal languages
- Principles of artificial Intelligence
- Principles of mobile robotics
- Bachelor thesis: Algorithmically Supported Scheduling (https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:l189-qucosa2-753784)

### University: Master of Science - 2023
I want to improve the skills I have learned and want to learn more, especially in areas of team management. So I thought that the master's degree is the best way for it.

#### Master Subjects:
- 3D Capture, Design and Dynamics
- Algorithm Engineering
- Progressive Web Apps
- Mixed Reality & AI
- Visualization in Natural Sciences and Engineering
- Innovative computer architectures
- Cryptography
- Object and gesture recognition
- Team management internship (SCRUM-team leader for an eight-person team)
- Master thesis: Development of an environmental simulation in Unity (https://github.com/poetter-sebastian/Simulation)
